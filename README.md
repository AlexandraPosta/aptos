### Forth year Disserdation designed by A. Posta, A. Monk, A. Durollet, O. Martin and S. Bruton

This repository holds the required files for the avionics firmware, control algorithm, web-server and testing technologies. 


TODO:
- Better understanding of the timers, clock speed, delays etc
- Start testing SPI & drivers. SPI needs to be copied from Hamilton firmware
- UART using servo uart port and TTL adapter
- PWM would allow full RGB LED coverage
